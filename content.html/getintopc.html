            <b class="b"> How many categories are there on the Getintopc website?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            All software and applications presented as publications are updated continuously.

            Its original purpose was to share games and PC software with free test reports. Now that Get Into PC is so
            popular among Internet users, it has expanded to include more features as a platform.

            If you have kept the things of your house in the right order, then it becomes easier for you to find your
            stuff. Just like if every software on this website placed in their category, then there is no problem in
            finding the software.

            For a sample, if you are looking for photo editing software, then for that, you will have to go to the
            category of Graphic Designing, and you will get some photo editing software. Think what if there is no
            category on the Software Downloading website, then you would have trouble finding it.

            Enter what you want in the search box and click Go. Click the link and scroll down.

            There will be a download button, click it, and your software will start downloading. Once downloaded, click
            the downloaded software on your system, and it will begin installing. And it’s done.

            There are many categories on Getintopc from where you can choose any category, and you will get whatever
            Software you want to find. If still not found, you can search the Website and find the Software.

            Here you can find nearly all available apps and computer skills, which mainly classified into main
            categories: software categories, OS, 3D Animation, 3D CAD, Graphic design, multimedia, visual effects,
            development, data recovery, antivirus, education, electronics, internet, tutorials, and donations.

           <b class="b">Is it Safe taking from Get into PC?</b>
           <br ><br><br>

            In case the software is illegal, is it safe to download it? If still, can you have problems like fines or
            viruses later?

            Firstly: The download/take from Get Into PC is safe. I am using this website for 2 years, and I found all
            are safe. Many other people who have downloaded also confirm its safety.

            Secondly, downloading from Get Into PC has advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, none of them is the
            threat of well-known viruses and malware.
